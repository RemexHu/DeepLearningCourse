HW1: Design a basic neural network to train a model from 50,000 training images to discern objects in 10 categories.

Feb 11 updates: The most basic and simplest neural network model with Gradient Descent Optimizer and L2 Regulator. Training part only. It's indeed a stupid model - at least it works!
No dropout, no momentum, no batch shuffle, no testing part. Needs to be added tomorrow.


Lots of amazings to come...

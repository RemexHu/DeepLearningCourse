# HW1: 

### Design a basic neural network to train a model from 50,000 training images to discern objects in 10 categories.  
---
### Feb 10 updates:  
The most basic and simplest neural network model with Gradient Descent Optimizer and L2 Regulator. Training part only. It's indeed a stupid model - __at least it works!__ No dropout, no momentum, no batch shuffle, no testing part.

Needs to be added tomorrow.

### Feb 11 updates:
Add Dropout, Batch shuffle, Testing part and changed into Adam Optimizor. It takes about 20 hours to finish training 500 epochs, but the acc is only around 50%. There mush be something wrong in the cost function.  

Needs to be further optimized.

This Repo is for NYU CS 9223 Deep Learning Course Projects.  


## HW1:   
Lots of thanks to my co-contributor @Edward_Chor.   
#### Objective:   
Design a basic neural network to train a model from 50,000 training images to discern objects in 10 categories.  
#### Dataset and Method
Dataset: CIFAR-10  
Regularization: Dropout, L2-Reg  
Optimizor: Adam  
Activation: ReLU


#### Results:
Successfully built up a three-layer dense neural network totally based on numpy. It takes 20 hours to train 500 epochs on CPU, and the performance is not bad (test acc is about 53%).  

## HW2:
Lots of thanks to my friend @Yao_QiuColumbia
#### Objective:
Design a Convolutional Neural Network based on TensorFlow. The model is derivatived form 50,000 training images to classify objects in 10 categories.
#### Dataset and Method:
Dataset: CIFAR-10  
Regularization: L2-norm  
Optimizor: Adam  
Activation: ReLu  
#### Results:  
So far best val_acc is 61.8%.  
Still working on it...  




Lots of amazings to come...

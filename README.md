# DeepLearningCourse  

This Repo is for NYU CS 9223 Deep Learning Course Projects.  


## HW1:   
Lots of thanks to my co-contributor @Edward_Chor.   
#### Objective:   
Design a basic neural network to train a model from 50,000 training images to discern objects in 10 categories.  
#### Dataset and Method
Dataset: CIFAR-10  
Regularization: Dropout, L2-Reg  
Optimizor: Adam  
Activation: ReLU


#### Results:
Successfully built up a three-layer dense neural network totally based on numpy. It takes 20 hours to train 500 epochs on CPU, and the performance is not that good (test acc is only around 50%).  

## HW2:
#### Objective:
Design a Convolutional Neural Network based on TensorFlow. The model is derivatived form 50,000 training images to classify objects in 10 categories.
#### Dataset and Method:
Dataset: CIFAR-10  
Regularization:  
Optimizor:  
Activation:  
#### Results:  
Still working...  




Lots of amazings to come...
